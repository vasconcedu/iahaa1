Iahaa1: Insecure as heck Android app (version 1) is a purposefully insecure Android app I coded as a means to practice Android security concepts. I might update it in the future to introduce new vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerabilities

The following vulnerabilities were introduced purposefully into Iahaa1:

- Intent redirection
- Inadequate external storage usage (up to API level 29)
- SQL injection
- Presence of sensitive unprotected component
- Weak crypto
- Unnecessary logging of sensitive information
- Implicit PendingIntent
